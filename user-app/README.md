# UserApp

UserApp is a user management portal for performing CRUD operations via integration with its backend API. Upon first use, no data will be present - you will need to start by creating a user from the UI.

## Development server

First, ensure the API is up and running. Instructions are available in the API directory root. Once completed, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
